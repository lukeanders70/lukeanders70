# Hi, I'm Luke Larson ðŸ‘‹

I'm a software engineer at Credit Karma, working on front end infrastructure. When I'm not tearing my hair out learning about web deveopment, I like to take a break and tear my hair out learning _game_ development instead. I also run a webcomic that's available at [bowlofbeans.com](https://bowlofbeans.com/), I don't tear my hair out working on that though, because I don't update it very often.
